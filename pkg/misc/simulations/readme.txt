## simulation.1.0 ##
Simulation using composite costs, including different habitat costs
(e.g. coast = 1/3 land). Sources in a fine grid of Africa. Takes between 6 and 9 hours.



## nullPath.1.0.R ##
Unique costs. Sources in a large grid, worldwide (190 nodes). Takes between 1-2
hours.



## nullPath.1.1.R ##
Unique costs. Sources in relatively large grid (104 nodes), restrained
to Africa. Runs in less than 1 hour.
