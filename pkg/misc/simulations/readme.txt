## simulation.1.0 ##
Simulation using composite costs, including different habitat costs
(e.g. coast = 1/3 land). Sources in a fine grid of Africa. Takes between 6 and 9 hours.



## nullPath.1.0.R ##
Unique costs. Sources in a large grid, worldwide (190 nodes). Takes between 1-2
hours.



## nullPath.1.1.R ##
Unique costs. Sources in relatively large grid (104 nodes), restrained
to Africa. Runs in less than 1 hour.



## withProd.1.0.R ##
Costs defined based on mean productivity (gC/m2/month), rescaled on
0-100. Runs in 30-40 minutes.



## withProd.1.1.R ##
Costs defined based on mean productivity (gC/m2/month), rescaled on
0-100, and on mean variance rescaled to 0-100, both being averaged. Runs in 30-40 minutes.
