frictionGraph

centers = data.frame of id, long and lat coordinates for centers with numeric id as rownames
habitat = habitat characteristics for vertices
habitatDef = habitat definitions (types, colours, costs)
edgesRef = all edges for the graph
edgesCost = edges weighted by the friction cost (with zero edges removed)
edgesRemoved = dataframe with vertices pairs of edges that have been removed
